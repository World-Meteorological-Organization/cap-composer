# üåç Originated in WMO Africa, now a Global Open-Source Initiative

The WMO CAP Compposer is a [Wagtail](https://wagtail.io/)
based [Common Alerting Protocol](https://docs.oasis-open.org/emergency/cap/v1.2/CAP-v1.2-os.html) (CAP) Warning
Composer developed by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) Regional Office for Africa (RAF).

This is a web-based tool for creating and managing CAP alerts. It is designed to be used by National Meteorological and
Hydrological Services (NMHSs), disaster management agencies, and other organizations that have the authority to publish
and disseminate CAP alerts.

The **Common Alerting Protocol (CAP)** provides an open, non-proprietary digital message format for all types of alerts
and notifications.

This tool formats published warnings into the CAP XML that follows the structure of the schema provided
at http://docs.oasis-open.org/emergency/cap/v1.2/CAP-v1.2-os.html
