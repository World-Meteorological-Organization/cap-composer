User management
===============

The Admin is responsible for managing users in the CAP Composer. 
The Admin can create, edit, and delete users. The Admin can also assign roles to users to control their access to the CAP Composer.

This page should define the recommendation for managing roles and users within the context of the CAP Composer: what roles should be created, what permission each role should have, and how to assign roles to users.
