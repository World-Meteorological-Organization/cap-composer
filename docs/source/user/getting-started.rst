Getting started
===============

The CAP Composer is a web-application based on `Wagtail <https://wagtail.io/>`_. 
Wagtail is an Open Source Content Management System (CMS) written in Python and built on the Django web framework.

The CAP Composer source code contains docker-compose files to help define the required services and dependencies to setup a standalone version of the CAP Composer.
The standalone version of the CAP Composer is a complete Wagtail project that includes the CAP Composer components. It will require a host with the necessary resources to run the docker-compose stack.

If you already have a Wagtail project and would like to integrate the CAP Composer components, you can install the CAP Composer as a set of Wagtail apps.

Host requirements for the standalone version
--------------------------------------------

The CAP Composer host requires a minimum of 4 vCPUs with 4GB Memory and 24GB of local storage.

The following software dependencies are required:

* Docker
* Docker Compose
