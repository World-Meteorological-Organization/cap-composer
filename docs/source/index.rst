The WMO CAP Composer is a web-application based on `Wagtail <https://wagtail.io/>`_ to help National Meteorological and
Hydrological Services (NMHSs) create and managing alerts formatted using the `Common Alerting Protocol <https://docs.oasis-open.org/emergency/cap/v1.2/CAP-v1.2-os.html>`_ (CAP).

Wagtail is an Open Source CMS written in Python and built on the Django web framework. 
By using Wagtail, the WMO CAP Composer can offer a user-friendly interface to create CAP alerts that can be drafted, reviewed, and published as pages on the website.
