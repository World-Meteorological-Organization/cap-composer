# CAP Composer documentation

The CAP Composer documentation is hosted on [Read the Docs](https://cap-composer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and developing using the [Sphinx Python Documentation Generator](https://www.sphinx-doc.org) using the [reStructuredText](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/index.html) format.

## Building the documentation

To test this documentation locally run `make html` (or `./make.bat html` on Windows) from the `docs` directory. This will generate the HTML documentation in the `docs/_build/html` directory.
